🚀 Superpowers: Making things fast, modular, and reliable - because good code should feel like wizardry, not a crime scene! \
🤖 Next Quest: Exploring AI & LLMs - because if robots are going to take over, I at least want them to have good manners! \
🏆 Believer in strong teams, taking ownership, and tackling challenges like they're the last piece of pizza at a party. \

Sharing is caring so... Let's build something awesome together! 🚀
